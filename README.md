1-What is JUnit?
JUnit is a unit testing open-source framework for the Java programming language. Java Developers use this framework to write and execute automated tests. In Java, there are test cases that have to be re-executed every time a new code is added. This is done to make sure that nothing in the code is broken. 

2-What is Unit Testing?
Unit testing, as the name suggests, refers to the testing of small segments of code. Here, a unit indicates the smallest bit of code that can be fetched out of the system. This small bit can be a line of the code, a method, or a class. The smaller the chunk of code, the better it is, as smaller chunks will tend to run faster. And this provides a better insight into the code and its performance.
